                        White Widow is a hybrid weed strain made from a genetic cross between a Brazilian sativa 
                        landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica. This strain is 60% sativa and 40% indica. 
                        White Widow is one of the most famous strains worldwide, first bred in the Netherlands by 
                        Green House Seeds in the 1990s. Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the 
                        potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, 
                        stimulating both conversation and creativity. </p>

                <p style=font-size:18px class="color">White Widow is 15% THC, making this strain an 
                ideal choice for moderate cannabis consumers. Leafly customers tell us White Widow effects 
                include feeling energetic, talkative, and creative. Medical marijuana patients often choose
                 White Widow when dealing with symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and pain. White Widow 
                 features flavors like woody, spicy/herbal, and earthy. The dominant terpenes of this strain are
                  myrcene and caryophyllene, though growing conditions and strain phenotypes may impact the exact blend. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style=font-size:18px class="color">White Widow is a balanced hybrid 
                  that can be enjoyed by both indica and sativa lovers. It has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and can be grown 
                  indoors or outdoors in mild climates. It produces chunky and conical buds with a loose and fluffy 
                  texture that are easy to break up despite their stickiness. If you’ve smoked, 
                dabbed, or consumed White Widow, tell us about your experience by leaving a strain review.
